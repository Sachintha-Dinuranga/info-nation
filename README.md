## APIs Used

1. **[REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/)**:

   - Provides data about countries, including name, population, region, languages, and flags.
   - Endpoints used:
     - `/v3.1/all` - Fetch all countries.
     - `/v3.1/name/{name}` - Search countries by name.
     - `/v3.1/region/{region}` - Filter countries by region.
     - `/v3.1/lang/{language}` - Filter countries by language.
     - `/v3.1/alpha/{code}` - Fetch details of a specific country.

2. **[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)**:
   - Used for user authentication and Firestore database integration.

## Challenges and Solutions

### 1. **Handling API Errors**

- **Challenge**: The REST Countries API sometimes returned errors for invalid queries or empty results.
- **Solution**: Implemented error handling with `try-catch` blocks and displayed user-friendly error messages.

### 2. **State Management**

- **Challenge**: Managing multiple states for search, filters, and favorites.
- **Solution**: Used React's `useState` and `useContext` hooks to manage state effectively. Created a `FavoritesContext` for managing favorite countries.

### 3. **Authentication**

- **Challenge**: Integrating Firebase Authentication with React and ensuring secure token storage.
- **Solution**: Used `react-firebase-hooks` for authentication and stored tokens securely in `localStorage`.

### 4. **Performance Optimization**

- **Challenge**: Loading all countries at once caused performance issues.
- **Solution**: Implemented lazy loading for components and paginated the country list using a "See More" button.
